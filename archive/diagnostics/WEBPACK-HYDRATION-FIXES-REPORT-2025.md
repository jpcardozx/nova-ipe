# Nova Ipê Webpack and Hydration Fixes - June 2, 2025

## Summary

All webpack configuration and hydration issues have been successfully fixed in the Nova Ipê website project. The development server now runs without any errors related to webpack configuration or component hydration mismatches.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Next.js Configuration Conflicts**:

   - Removed deprecated `serverActions` option from experimental settings (this is enabled by default in Next.js 14+)
   - Ensured proper `serverComponentsExternalPackages` configuration to avoid conflicts with `transpilePackages`

2. **Webpack Externals Function Parameters**:

   - Updated all webpack externals functions to use the modern parameter format:
     - Changed `(context, request, callback) => {...}` to `({context, request}, cb) => {...}`
     - Updated callback usage from `callback()` to `cb()`

3. **Project Configuration**:
   - Ensured `path` module is properly imported in webpack configuration files
   - Added `projectRoot` initialization for consistent file path resolution

## Results

✅ Development server starts without errors  
✅ No webpack deprecation warnings  
✅ No hydration mismatches between server and client  
✅ Component rendering works correctly  
✅ Automatic fixes are applied before server startup

## How to Run the Fixed Project

The following npm scripts have been configured for simplified development:

```bash
# Run development server with all fixes applied
npm run dev:safe

# Complete fix and build process
npm run fix:config-conflicts && npm run build:clean

# Full diagnostic and fix cycle
npm run diagnostic && npm run smart-fix && npm run dev:clean
```

## Verification

To verify the fixes are working correctly:

1. Run `npm run dev:safe` to start the development server with all fixes applied
2. Check the console for any webpack or hydration-related errors
3. Navigate through the website to ensure all components are rendering correctly

## Future Recommendations

1. Keep all webpack-related configuration in a single file to avoid conflicts
2. Use the configuration conflict resolver before making changes to Next.js config
3. Always use the latest function parameter formats recommended by webpack
4. Keep dependencies up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues
