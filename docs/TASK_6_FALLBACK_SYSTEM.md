# Task 6: Fallback Data System Implementation

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive fallback data system for when Sanity CMS is unavailable. The system ensures application continuity while providing clear diagnostic information and user notifications about degraded functionality.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Fallback Data System (`lib/sanity/fallback-data.ts`)

- **Comprehensive Mock Data**: 6 realistic property entries covering different types (houses, apartments, land)
- **Clear Indicators**: All fallback data includes "(Sanity Indisponível)" in titles
- **Smart Query Analysis**: Automatically determines appropriate fallback data based on query patterns
- **Usage Tracking**: Logs all fallback usage for debugging and monitoring
- **Diagnostic Tools**: Functions to generate reports and statistics

**Key Functions:**

- `getFallbackData()`: Returns appropriate mock data based on query type
- `getFallbackUsageStats()`: Provides usage statistics for monitoring
- `generateFallbackDiagnosticReport()`: Creates detailed diagnostic reports
- `isFallbackSystemOverused()`: Detects when fallback is being used excessively

### 2. User Notification System

#### Fallback Notification Component (`components/ui/fallback-notification.tsx`)

- **Toast-style Notifications**: Slide-in notifications with proper animations
- **Multiple Types**: Warning, error, and info notifications
- **Retry Functionality**: Built-in retry button for connection attempts
- **Auto-dismiss**: Configurable auto-dismiss for success messages
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

#### System Status Components (`components/ui/system-status.tsx`)

- **SystemStatus**: Full status widget with details and retry functionality
- **SystemStatusBadge**: Minimal badge for headers/navigation
- **PropertyListingStatus**: Specific warning for property listings

### 3. Global State Management (`contexts/fallback-context.tsx`)

- **FallbackProvider**: React context provider for global fallback state
- **Automatic Monitoring**: Periodic checks for fallback usage
- **Notification Management**: Centralized notification control
- **Health Monitoring Integration**: Connects with Sanity health checks
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Built-in connection retry functionality

### 4. Health Monitoring System (`lib/sanity/health-monitor.ts`)

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Automatic health checks every minute
- **Health History**: Tracks connection health over time
- **Statistics**: Success rates, response times, error counts
- **Recommendations**: Automatic suggestions based on health data
- **Diagnostic Reports**: Comprehensive health reports for debugging

### 5. Enhanced Operations Integration

Updated `lib/sanity/enhanced-operations.ts` to:

- Use property-specific fallback data for property queries
- Provide clear logging when fallback is activated
- Integrate with health monitoring system
- Maintain detailed error tracking

## Implementation Details

### Fallback Data Structure

```typescript
interface FallbackProperty {
  _id: string;
  titulo: string; // Includes "(Sanity Indisponível)" indicator
  slug: { current: string };
  preco: number;
  finalidade: 'Venda' | 'Aluguel';
  // ... complete property structure
}
```

### Query Pattern Recognition

The system analyzes GROQ queries to determine appropriate fallback data:

- `finalidade == "Venda"` → Sale properties
- `finalidade == "Aluguel"` → Rental properties
- `destaque == true` → Featured properties
- `emAlta == true` → Hot properties
- `slug.current == $slug` → Single property by slug
- `[0]` → Single item queries
- Array queries → Multiple properties with limits

### Notification Flow

1. **Detection**: System detects Sanity unavailability
2. **Fallback Activation**: Mock data is served automatically
3. **User Notification**: Toast notification appears informing user
4. **Status Display**: System status components show degraded mode
5. **Retry Option**: Users can manually retry connection
6. **Auto-Recovery**: System automatically detects when connection is restored

### Diagnostic Information

The system provides detailed diagnostic information without pretending to be connected:

- All fallback data clearly marked as temporary
- Comprehensive logging of fallback usage
- Health monitoring with statistics
- Error tracking and categorization
- Diagnostic reports for debugging

## Integration Points

### Layout Integration

- `FallbackProvider` added to main layout (`app/layout.tsx`)
- Wraps entire application for global state management

### Homepage Integration

- `PropertyListingStatus` component added to show system status
- Automatic detection of fallback mode

### Enhanced Operations

- All Sanity queries now use enhanced operations with fallback
- Automatic fallback activation on connection failures
- Clear logging and monitoring integration

## Testing

Created comprehensive test script (`scripts/test-fallback-system.js`) that verifies:

- ✅ Fallback data structure and exports
- ✅ Notification component functionality
- ✅ Context integration
- ✅ Health monitoring system
- ✅ Enhanced operations integration
- ✅ Layout integration
- ✅ TypeScript compilation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Automatic)

```typescript
// Queries automatically use fallback when Sanity is unavailable
const properties = await getImoveisDestaque();
// Returns fallback data if Sanity is down, with clear indicators
```

### Manual Notification

```typescript
const { showFallbackNotification } = useFallback();
showFallbackNotification('Custom message about system status');
```

### Health Monitoring

```typescript
import { sanityHealthMonitor } from '../lib/sanity/health-monitor';

// Get current health status
const status = sanityHealthMonitor.getCurrentHealthStatus();

// Generate diagnostic report
const report = sanityHealthMonitor.generateHealthReport();
```

## Key Benefits

1. **System Stability**: Application continues functioning even when Sanity is unavailable
2. **User Awareness**: Clear notifications about system status and data freshness
3. **Debugging Support**: Comprehensive logging and diagnostic tools
4. **Automatic Recovery**: System detects and recovers from connection issues
5. **No Deception**: Never pretends to be connected - always honest about fallback status

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **Requirement 3.1**: Mock data serving when Sanity queries fail
✅ **Requirement 3.2**: Precise diagnostic information (no pretending to be connected)
✅ **Requirement 3.3**: Application continues to function with fallback data
✅ **Additional**: User notifications about degraded functionality

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:

- `components/ui/fallback-notification.tsx` - Notification components
- `components/ui/system-status.tsx` - Status display components
- `contexts/fallback-context.tsx` - Global state management
- `lib/sanity/health-monitor.ts` - Health monitoring system
- `scripts/test-fallback-system.js` - Comprehensive test script

- **Fallback Usage Logs**: Monitor when and why fallback is used
- **Diagnostic Reports**: Generate detailed reports for troubleshooting
- **Automatic Alerts**: System detects and reports degraded performance

This implementation ensures robust system operation while maintaining transparency about system status and providing excellent user experience even during service disruptions.
