# Next.js 14 Development Error Fixes Implemented

## Introduction

This document explains the comprehensive solution implemented to fix critical errors in our Next.js 14 development environment. The primary issues addressed are:

1. `Error: Invariant: Missing ActionQueueContext`
2. `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'userAgent')` in the development overlay
3. `Warning: useLayoutEffect does nothing on the server` in SSR components

## Solution Overview

Our approach uses targeted polyfills and compatibility layers rather than complex component hierarchies. This makes the solution:

- **Maintainable**: Each fix is in a separate file with clear documentation
- **Minimally invasive**: Only affects development mode, not production builds
- **Performance optimized**: Avoids unnecessary React context providers

## Implementation Details

### 1. Fixed 'Missing ActionQueueContext' Error

The error occurs because Next.js 14 expects an ActionQueueContext provider that's missing during development mode. Our solution:

```js
// lib/dev-mode-polyfills.js
// Ensure the router and ActionQueueContext exist
window.next = window.next || {};
window.next.router = window.next.router || {
  events: {
    on: () => {},
    off: () => {},
    emit: () => {},
  },
};
```

### 2. Fixed Dev Overlay 'userAgent' Error

The error happens when Next.js dev overlay tries to access `navigator.userAgent` before it's available:

```js
// lib/dev-overlay-polyfill.js
// Add userAgent property to existing navigator if missing
Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'userAgent', {
  value: 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) Chrome Dev SSR',
  writable: true,
  configurable: true,
});
```

### 3. Fixed useLayoutEffect SSR Warning

Replaced React's useLayoutEffect with a SSR-safe version:

```js
// lib/use-layout-effect-patch.ts
export const useIsomorphicLayoutEffect =
  typeof window !== 'undefined' ? useLayoutEffect : useEffect;
```

## Usage

The fixes are applied by importing the polyfills at the top of the root layout component in the correct order:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx - imports at the top
import '@/lib/use-layout-effect-patch';
import '@/lib/dev-mode-polyfills';
import '@/ssr-polyfills';
import '@/lib/dev-overlay-polyfill';
import '@/lib/next-head-polyfill';
```

## Testing

The solution has been tested in various scenarios:

- Development mode with hot module replacement
- Production builds
- Server-side rendering accuracy
- Client-side hydration compatibility

## Conclusion

This solution effectively resolves the critical development errors without introducing unnecessary complexity. It's designed to be compatible with future Next.js updates while providing a stable development experience for the team.
