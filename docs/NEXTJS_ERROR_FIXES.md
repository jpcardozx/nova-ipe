# Next.js 14 Error Fixes

This document describes the fixes implemented to resolve common errors in Next.js 14 development mode.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. `Error: Invariant: Missing ActionQueueContext`

This error occurs in Next.js 14 development mode when the internal ActionQueueContext is expected but not available.

**Solution implemented:**

- Created a polyfill for the ActionQueueContext in `lib/next-context-polyfills.tsx`
- Added `NextContextProvider` to wrap the application
- Added context values that mimic the expected behavior

### 2. `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'userAgent')`

This error occurs in the Next.js dev overlay when it tries to access `navigator.userAgent` during server-side rendering.

**Solution implemented:**

- Added comprehensive navigator polyfills in `lib/dev-overlay-polyfill.ts`
- Enhanced the SSR polyfills to provide more browser APIs in `lib/ssr-polyfills.ts`
- Added development-only error handling to intercept and prevent these errors

### 3. Enhanced Developer Experience

To provide a better development experience overall:

- Added `NextDeveloperExperienceEnhancer` component to catch and fix common Next.js development errors
- Improved error messaging for Next.js-specific errors
- Patched global objects like window, document, and navigator to be more compatible with Next.js internal expectations

## Testing

To verify the fixes, run the development server with:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

And check that:

1. The app loads without ActionQueueContext errors
2. The dev overlay works properly without userAgent errors
3. Navigation and interactivity work as expected

## Production Readiness

These fixes are development-only and won't impact production builds. The polyfills are conditionally loaded only in development mode.

To test production:

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run start
```
