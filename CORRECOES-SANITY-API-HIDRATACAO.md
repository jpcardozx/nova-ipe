# Sanity API and Hydration Issues - Resolution

## Problems Identified

1. **Sanity API Error**:
   - Request error when trying to reach https://0nks58lj.apicdn.sanity.io/v2024-04-17/data/query/production
   - Root cause: Case inconsistency in GROQ queries - mixing "aluguel" (lowercase) and "Aluguel" (capitalized)

2. **Hydration Errors**:
   - Whitespace text nodes as direct children of `<html>` tag
   - Mismatched client/server rendered attributes in the `<body>` tag transitions

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Sanity Query Issues
- Fixed case consistency in all GROQ queries to use "Aluguel" with capital A
- Added improved error handling in Sanity client with timeouts and fallbacks
- Created diagnostic utilities and API endpoints to troubleshoot Sanity issues

### 2. Hydration Issues
- Restructured HTML in layout.tsx to avoid whitespace between tags
- Improved body visibility transition handling to prevent hydration mismatches
- Separated head tags for better readability and prevention of unintended whitespace

### 3. Error Resilience
- Added timeout protection to all Sanity requests to prevent hanging
- Implemented fallback empty arrays instead of throwing errors
- Added diagnostic tools to validate image references

## Testing Recommendations

1. Check the homepage rendering with the Sanity rental properties query
2. Monitor browser console for any remaining hydration warnings
3. Use the new `/api/debug/sanity` endpoint with the proper secret to test Sanity queries

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing a more robust circuit breaker pattern for Sanity queries
2. Add client-side error boundary components for graceful UI fallbacks
3. Use Suspense boundaries more strategically to improve loading states
