# Dynamic Import Webpack Fix

**Date:** May 23, 2025
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Project:** Nova IPE Next.js Website

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing runtime crashes with the error:

```
Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')
at options.factory (webpack.js:712:31)
```

This error occurred in app-pages-internals.js and was related to various client components. The issue was caused by Webpack attempting to call a function on an undefined module export during dynamic imports.

## Root Cause

After investigation, we determined the root cause was:

**Named exports being used where default exports were expected**

When a module is imported with `dynamic(() => import('./path'))`, Next.js/Webpack expects a default export. However, some modules only had named exports or exported empty objects, which resulted in the `options.factory` being undefined when Webpack tried to call it.

## Solution Implemented

We implemented a comprehensive fix with these components:

### 1. SafeDynamicImport Utility

Created a utility function in `app/utils/dynamic-import-fix.ts` that:
- Ensures dynamic imports always have a valid default export
- Transforms named exports to default exports when needed
- Provides fallback components when imports fail
- Handles error cases safely

### 2. Enhanced Dynamic Import Wrapper

Modified the existing `DynamicImportWrapper.tsx` to:
- Handle modules with only named exports
- Detect empty modules and provide fallbacks
- Implement retry logic for failed imports
- Normalize module exports to prevent undefined function calls

### 3. Component-Level Fixes

Added default exports to components that were missing them:
- `instrumentation-client.ts`
- `debug-tools.tsx`

### 4. Updated Import Patterns

Refactored dynamic imports in:
- `page-client.tsx`
- `ClientComponents.tsx`

## Usage Guidelines

When dynamically importing components:

```typescript
// ❌ AVOID THIS PATTERN - May cause "undefined.call" errors
const Component = dynamic(() => import('./path/to/component'));

// ✅ USE THIS PATTERN INSTEAD - Handles all edge cases
import { safeDynamicImport } from '../utils/dynamic-import-fix';
const Component = dynamic(() => 
  safeDynamicImport(import('./path/to/component'), 'ComponentName')
);
```

## Testing

The fix has been verified by:
- Running a clean build of the application
- Testing dynamic imports in development mode
- Verifying all client components load correctly
- Ensuring no webpack console errors appear

## Future Considerations

- Consider adopting React.lazy() when Next.js supports it fully
- Review all dynamic imports periodically to ensure proper export patterns
- Add automated tests for component loading
