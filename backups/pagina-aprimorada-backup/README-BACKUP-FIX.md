# Backup Files Fix

## Description
This directory contains backup files from the main application. To fix module resolution issues in the Vercel deployment, we've created proxy files that redirect imports to the correct location in the main app.

## Structure
- `components/` - Contains proxy components that import from `../../../app/components/`
- `sections/` - Contains proxy files for section components
- `PropertyTypeFix.ts` - Proxy for the main PropertyTypeFix.ts

## How it Works
The proxy files maintain the same API (exports) as the original files but change the import path to point to the main application components. This allows the backup files to be included in the build without breaking.

## Maintenance
If you add new components to the backup files, make sure to create corresponding proxy components in this directory structure.
