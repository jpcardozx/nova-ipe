# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current authentication system is experiencing critical failures that prevent users from accessing the application and submitting access requests. The Sanity CMS integration is failing with "Unauthorized - Session not found" errors, and the signup form is throwing JavaScript errors when users attempt to submit access requests. This feature will address these authentication issues and ensure a robust, working authentication flow for both the main application and Sanity Studio access.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a potential user, I want to successfully submit access requests through the signup form, so that I can gain access to the system without encountering JavaScript errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user fills out the signup form with valid data THEN the system SHALL successfully submit the access request without throwing JavaScript errors
2. WHEN the form submission is successful THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message and reset the form
3. IF the form submission fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining what went wrong
4. WHEN a user submits a duplicate email THEN the system SHALL prevent the submission and inform the user that a request already exists

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the Sanity Studio authentication to work properly, so that I can manage content without encountering session errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the Sanity Studio THEN the system SHALL authenticate properly without "Session not found" errors
2. WHEN Sanity queries are executed THEN the system SHALL have valid authentication tokens and permissions
3. IF Sanity authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback data and log the error appropriately
4. WHEN the Sanity client is initialized THEN it SHALL use the correct authentication configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want the property data to load correctly, so that I can browse available properties without seeing authentication errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the homepage loads THEN property data SHALL be fetched successfully from Sanity
2. IF Sanity queries fail due to authentication THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to mock data
3. WHEN property queries execute THEN they SHALL not throw "Unauthorized" errors in the console
4. WHEN the application starts THEN all Sanity-related authentication SHALL be properly configured

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can diagnose and fix authentication issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. WHEN Sanity queries fail THEN the error SHALL be caught and handled gracefully without breaking the UI
3. IF the signup form encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide specific feedback about what failed
4. WHEN authentication tokens expire THEN the system SHALL handle token refresh or prompt for re-authentication

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication configuration to be properly set up, so that both client-side and server-side authentication work consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN all required environment variables SHALL be present and valid
2. WHEN Sanity client is created THEN it SHALL use the correct project ID, dataset, and authentication tokens
3. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating what needs to be configured
4. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL use consistent authentication methods across client and server

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the login flow to work seamlessly with both dashboard and Sanity Studio access, so that I can access the appropriate interface based on my role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects "Dashboard" mode THEN they SHALL be authenticated for the main application
2. WHEN a user selects "Est√∫dio" mode THEN they SHALL be redirected to Sanity Studio with proper authentication
3. IF authentication fails THEN the user SHALL receive clear feedback about the failure reason
4. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the user SHALL be redirected to the appropriate interface without errors
