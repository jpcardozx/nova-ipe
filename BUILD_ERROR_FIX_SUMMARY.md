# Build Error Fix Summary

## The Problem

The project was encountering "Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined" errors during the build process.

## Root Causes Identified

1. Inconsistent export patterns across components
2. Circular dependencies between components
3. Path resolution issues with imports/exports
4. Component imports that resolve during development but fail during build

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Consistent Component Export Patterns

- Standardized all component exports to use default exports
- Removed dual export patterns (both named and default) to avoid confusion

### 2. Build-Safe Component Architecture

- Created a build-safe wrapper for PropertyCard component
- Implemented proper error handling with fallback components
- Centralized type definitions and exports

### 3. Import Path Fixes

- Updated relative paths to use project-root paths (@/app/...)
- Created barrel files for better component organization
- Simplified component imports

### 4. Fallback System

- Added defensive coding with try/catch
- Created FallbackPropertyCard for graceful degradation
- Added runtime checks for undefined components

### Test Instructions

1. Run `npm run build` to verify the build completes without errors
2. Check `/imovel/[slug]` pages to ensure they render correctly
3. Verify property listings on the home page load properly

## Additional Recommendations

- Consider adding error boundaries around key components
- Add a monitoring system for dynamic imports
- Review circular dependencies in the component architecture
