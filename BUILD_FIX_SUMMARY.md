# Build Error Fix: Webpack Runtime TypeError

## Problem
The build was failing with:
```
unhandledRejection TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading length)
at webpack-runtime.js
```

## Root Cause
- Webpack runtime was trying to access `length` property on undefined arrays
- This typically happens with split chunks configuration when module arrays are not properly initialized
- The error was originating from the server-side _document.js compilation

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `webpack-patch-simple.js`
- Disabled split chunks temporarily to prevent array access errors
- Set `concatenateModules: false` to avoid module concatenation issues
- Used `globalThis` instead of `self` for better compatibility

### 2. Updated `next.config.js`
- Added server-side optimization disabling
- Switched to simplified webpack patch

### 3. Key Changes
```javascript
// In webpack-patch-simple.js
config.optimization.splitChunks = false; // Temporarily disable
config.optimization.concatenateModules = false;
config.output.globalObject = 'globalThis';
```

## Testing
To verify the fix works:
```bash
npx next build
```

The error should no longer appear in the webpack runtime during _document.js compilation.

## Next Steps
1. Once build is confirmed working, gradually re-enable optimizations
2. Test with `config.optimization.splitChunks = { chunks: 'all' }` 
3. Monitor for any recurring webpack runtime errors
